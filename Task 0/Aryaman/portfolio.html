        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have a passion for programming. I spend quite a lot of time on the popular competitve coding website, 
          <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a>. <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/_aryaman?h_r=internal-search&hr_r=1">Here</a> 
           is a link to my profile on the website. My language skills include <b>C</b> and <b>Python</b>. I also watch a lot of movies and TV shows. 
           I am a fan Christopher Nolan movies among which Inception is my favourite. Breaking Bad is my favourite television show and I also
           used to love Game of Thrones. I love learning about science and technology and I'm a big fan of Elon Musk. I also play a lot of 
           badminton and table tennis occasionally. Spending time with friends is also an effective pastime. 
        </p>
        <h2>Life at NITK</h2>
        <p>NITK has been a revelation for me. I expected a lot from it and I have not been disappointed. Hostels aren't good but hostel
            life has been amazing because of a lot of friends. There are many different kinds of people which is also good. Classes have also been
            okay. So there's nothing much to complain about.
